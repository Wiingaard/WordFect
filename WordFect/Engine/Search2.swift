 For every position on the board it does (should):
 1. Find all the permutations on the tray also considering jokers.
 2. Find the minimum and maximum length a word can be by considering which bricks are places on the board including rows in close proximity to search position.
 3. Make all potential words matching the length requirements by merging tray bricks with placed bricks.
